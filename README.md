Card games programmed in Ruby.

I used the Card and Deck classes from the SitePoint Ruby 2.0 course's Play Your Cards Right game to program other card games.

The first card game I programmed is War. The player clicks to continue after each battle.

The second card game I programmed is Blackjack. The player can choose to Hit or Stand.
